# @qr-suite/matrix

This is a port of [qr-image](https://github.com/Short-io/qr-image)'s base and matrix features to TypeScript.  
Currently it supports encoding, generating error correction codes and matrices.  
Encoding supports alphanumeric strings, numbers, binary data (8 bits/char) and URLs (https only, experimental).

## TODO

- optimizations
- tests
