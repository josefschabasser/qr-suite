# @qr-suite/terminal

This is a library to display QR codes on a terminal using [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) and bundled [@qr-suite/matrix](https://github.com/josefschabasser/qr-suite/tree/develop/packages/matrix).  
Currently it supports normal and small mode, changing colors and borders (experimental).
