# @qr-suite/terminal

This is a library to display QR codes on a terminal using bundled [@qr-suite/matrix](https://github.com/josefschabasser/qr-suite/tree/develop/packages/matrix).  
Currently it supports small/medium/large mode, error correction levels, borders (experimental) and optimizing the QR code for URLs (experimental).  
The small QR codes are experimental, too (highly distorted, must be converted to medium to be usable, but saves characters).

## TODO

- optimizations
- tests
